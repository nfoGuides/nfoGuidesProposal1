Temproarily Unlocking Soulbound Cards Proposal

# Unlocking Soulbound Cards concept

## Main Items:

 * Soulbound cards can be temporarily unlocked\.  Never permanently unlocked\.
 * Soulbound cards can never be burned for DEC
 * This main proposal doesn’t apply to Soulbound Gladius cards\.  Gladius Cards can be separate options on this\.

## Fee to Temporarily unlock a soulbound card:

 * For this document we will talk about the fee being 10 vouchers, or $1 worth of vouchers\.
 * The fee would be set by a $ cost paid in vouchers only\.  i\.e\.  $1 worth of vouchers\.
 * The $ amount or number of vouchers could be anything just using these values as a discussion point\.	
 * The soulbound card BCX or Level does not matter\.  It’s the same for any 1 card\.  Gold or Regular\. Always the same fee to temporarily unlock a soulbound card\.
 * A % of all fee’s would go to the DAO, the rest would be burnt\.

## How it would work:

### Sending a card to another IGN
 * Select the card like normal 
 * On the send screen it will show how many vouchers \(or $ cost in vouchers based on current market price\) it will cost to temporarily unlock the card for this action
 * If you have enough vouchers to cover the cost,  you can hit send and the card is transferred to the new IGN\.
 * The Voucher fee will be deducted from your balance\.
 * The new owner of the card gets the card in their account, and its soulbound to them\.
 * Any future actions to move the card around will incur the voucher fee\.
### Delegating a card to another IGN
 * Select the card like normal 
 * On the Delegate screen it will show how many vouchers \(or $ cost in vouchers based on current market price\) it will cost to temporarily unlock the card for this action
 * If you have enough vouchers to cover the cost, you can hit send and the card is delegated to the new IGN\.
 * The Voucher fee will be deducted from your balance\.
 * The ownership of the card never changes\.  
 * The IGN with the delegated card can play with that card indefinitely\. With no additional fees occurring\.
 * When you undelegate the card it comes back into your account like normal and is soulbound to your account again\.
 * Any future actions to move the card around will incur the voucher fee\.
### If you want to sell the card on the market\.  
 * Select the card like normal and enter the amount your selling it for\.
 * On the Sell screen it will show how many vouchers \(or $ cost in vouchers based on current market price\) it will cost to temporarily unlock the card for this action
 * If you have enough vouchers to cover the cost, you can hit send and the card is Listed on the market for sale\.
 * The card is temporarily unlocked and listed for sale on the market\.
 * If you want to change the price of the temporarily unlocked card on the market that hasn’t sold yet\.  You will have to pay another voucher fee for the price change\.
 * When a customer buys the card, they don’t pay ANY fee in vouchers\.  That’s already been paid\.
 * Customer gets the card, and the card will soulbound itself to the new owner\.
 * Any future actions to move the card around will incur the voucher fee\.
### If you want to RENT the card out to others\.
 * Select the card like normal and enter the amount your renting it out for\.
 * On the Rent screen it will show how many vouchers \(or $ cost in vouchers based on current market price\) it will cost to temporarily unlock the card for this action\.
 * If you have enough vouchers to cover the cost, you can hit send and the card is listed on the market for rent\.
 * If you want to change the price of the temporarily unlocked card on the market that’s for rent\.  You will have to pay another voucher fee for the price change\.
 * The soulbound card is now available to other for rent\.
 * Every customer can rent the card like normal, never having to pay a voucher fee to do the rental\. 
 * For the entire time it’s on the rental market you won’t have to pay any additional fees as people rent it\.  Unrent it, rent it again…
 * When you pull the card OFF the rental market\.  The soulbound card is locked again to your account\.  
 * Any future actions to move the card around will incur the voucher fee\.
### Sending a card to work on land
 * Select the card like normal 
 * Assign the card to the plot you want the card to work on\.
 * On the card worker assignment screen it will show how many vouchers \(or $ cost in vouchers based on current market price\) it will cost to temporarily unlock the card for this action
 * If you have enough vouchers the card becomes a worker, and works\.
 * When you pull the soulbound card off from land\.  It becomes soulbound again to your account\. Along with the cooldown period\.
 * Any future actions to move the card around will incur the voucher fee\.

# Frequently asked Questions:

### Why use vouchers,  why not DEC or SPS
 * Vouchers are given to us players that have staked our SPS and we get vouchers for free\.  So vouchers is a access token for us to move these cards around potentially with no cost\.    
 * Bot farms, \(not people with 5\-10 accounts\) true bot farms, have far mor accounts then they do staked SPS\.  So the amount of vouchers they are getting is minimal compared to the number of cards they are sitting on\.  If we use SPS, well bot farms get that SPS in battles and have it to burn to move cards or burn to DEC to once again burn cards, while still avoiding to play the game like a real person and keep the SPS staked\.  Vouchers will force the bot farms to buy the vouchers from us \(what I will call\) Human Players\.   So while the botfarms got tons of cards\.  They will have to buy vouchers from us humans to move them around\.   So all of us humans will profit from the bot farms by them buying the vouchers from us humans\.   Humans win\.

### Ithink this way of treating soulbound cards kind of sucks\. Why ? cause silver and gold players are kind of fcked \. If it costs a lot to sell most sales will be of maxed ,it seems\. So if silver player is missing one particular soulbound card should they pay price for 400bcx common when they only need 60bcx worth ? Given that they have for example only 55bcx themselves and there is Zero available 5bcx commons to buy? so ,they need 5 bcx but need to now buy 400 bcx? Sounds like a bad idea just due to that\. Every other reasoning and benefits seems great\.
 * Initially i agree this seems like people would only sell max copies of cards\.   But i have thought about this alot and would counter with:  there is a small number of people willing to buy Max copies of cards\.   I believe the market will "market"  and as a seller if i know i can move 5 BCX cards like candy\.  yes the fee i need to list it will be the base starting price of that card\.  but i will rinse and repeat this for low level BCX cards if the market is buying them\.  I would rather list 20 cards at 5 bcx and sell them in 1 day\.  then list a 400 bcx card and perhaps not get a sale the whole month\.  and after 30 the market will delist the card\.  and i will have to pay the fee again to list it at max\.   Really appreciate your thoughts\!
